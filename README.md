# CalculatorApp

Testing out a Calculator which is designed to work across different platforms. Currently, on Windows it compiles 
with Microsoft Visual Studio 2017. On Linux, Netbeans is used for compilation. 


# Blabbering 

This information is currently for my own record so that I have fine grain control over the project 

* *./build/* : Linux compiles files into .o (object) files and puts these here. No need to check-in these
* *./nbproject/* : Project files for netbeans about configuration. Possibly difficult to move
* *./dist/* : Folder where application for Linux is written. Do not checkin this.
